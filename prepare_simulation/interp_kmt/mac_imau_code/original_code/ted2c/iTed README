README file for iTed, the Interactive Topography EDitor.

Written 2/9/2006 by Bob Malone (semi-retired, LANL, CCS-2).

This code was originally written in C++ by Pat McCormick (LANL, Advanced Computing Laboratory, CCS-1) for use on IRIX workstations. Now (Feb 2006) IRIX has gone away, so the obvious choice was MacOSX 10.4 (Tiger). In the process of converting the code to run on the Mac, I made the following changes:
	(1) I gave the code a (new?) name, using Apple’s time-proven strategy of taking a Keyword or two and putting an ‘i’ in front (iMac, iPod, iPhoto,..).
	(2) I replaced the “cmdline” user interface with a C++ emulation of Fortran’s Namelist interface that I wrote several years ago for use in C++ codes.  It has the important advantage that code users, who are mostly Fortran users, will generally know better how to use it. 
	(3) I added “zoomBoxSize” to the “control” namelist. Its default value is 25 (units?).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: First of all, you need a Mac with a G4 or G5 processor running MAC OS X 10.3 or later. Second, you have to install the Apple Developer’s Toolkit.  It comes free of charge on the same DVD when you buy (or bought) your latest MAC OS X upgrade. This gives you access to the GNU compiler suite and the OpenGL libraries.

INSTALLING: after un’tar’ing the sourcefile, it is necessary to do 3 separate ‘make’s. First cd into the Utilities subdirectory and run ‘make’. Then cd into the Namelist subdirectory and run ‘make’. Finally “cd ..” back to the main directory and run a third ‘make’ to compile and build iTed.  

USAGE: Once the code is built, two input files are required to run:
	(A) A tiny text file containing the namelist input (see example below). Its default name is “nml_input.txt”. If you have a file by that name in the same subdirectory as iTed, the code will automoatically open it, if you just type
		iTed  (or ./iTed, if necessary).
If you want to use another input file, say, test_v18j.txt, then type:
		iTed test_v18j.txt
or
		iTed test_v18j.txt > output
which permits redirection of stdout to the print file “output”. Note that this is NOT the same as:
		iTed < test_v18j.txt
which redirects the contents of test_v18j.txt into the <cstdio> style with    “cin >> variable”. A sample input file follows:
			&control
			xdim =1280
			ydim = 896
			kmt_file = kmt1280
			zoomBoxSize = 100
			/
The name of the namelist is “control” and is preceeded by an ampersand (&). The end of the namelist input is denoted by the ‘/’.  In normal applications, the file would contain multiple namelists with different names and parameters.
	(B) The second file contains the pixilated gridpoints of the specified grid. Colors distinguish the deptb variations. iTed permits the user to “edit” the ocean bottom depths. The name of this file used in the code is “kmt_file” and its name appears in the control namelist. Note that no quotation marks are needed on the right-hand side of the equal sign, if the string is purely alphanumeric and contains no spaces.
